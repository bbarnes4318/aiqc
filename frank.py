I have noticed a concerning pattern of unusually short call durations during live transfer calls handled by one of our licensed agents. This situation necessitates a thorough investigation to pinpoint the underlying cause of these fleeting interactions. We need to discern whether the short call durations stem from the call center's possibly insufficient qualification of prospects, or if they are due to our agent's potential lack of effective engagement with the customers.

To provide some context on our procedure: Each call initiates with a call center representative who interacts with the prospect first. After conducting a preliminary assessment through a series of questions, the prospect is then transferred to our licensed agent. This process is consistent across all calls, which should help in distinguishing the roles of the call center representative and the licensed agent during the analysis.

I am seeking an exhaustive analysis to ascertain where the responsibility lies for the abbreviated call durations. Additionally, I would greatly appreciate any insights or strategic recommendations that could serve to refine our call center's prospect qualification protocols and elevate our licensed agent's customer interaction techniques.
